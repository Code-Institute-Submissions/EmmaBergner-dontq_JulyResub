# DontQ
__Live Site:__
[DontQ](https://emmabergner.github.io/dontq/) 


DontQ is a queuing web browser application. By scanning a QR-code when entering the store, you will automatically receive your number for the queue. And be updated on queue numbers remaining. 

The idea is, instead of printing out tickets, the customer scan the QR-code and its queue number is displayed straight on the phone. This application can be used in any store that uses any sort of queuing system, using numbers. 


## User Experience
### User Stories
__User/Customer__
- As a user I want a queue number so that I know when it is my turn.
- As a user I want to be updated on the current number so that I can claim my turn in time.

__Business__
- As a business I want to be able to control the current number so that the queue number is correct.
- As a business I want to be able to sign in with username and password so that I can access my queue.

__Superuser / Admin__
- As a site owner I want to be able to add new businesses so that they can use the service.
- As a site owner I want to be able to remove businesses so that they can not use the service.
- As a site owner I want to have separate queues so that more then one business can use my service at the same time.
