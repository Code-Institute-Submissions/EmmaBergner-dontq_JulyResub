[DontQ](https://emmabergner.github.io/dontq/) 

DontQ is a queuing web browser application and service where businesses can offer their customers an easy and sustainable way of queueing. With DontQ, your customer will receive an queueing number straight in the phone. 

By scanning a QR-code when entering the store customers will automatically receive their queueing number. They will be updated on current number, remaining queueing numbers and a message when it is their turn. 

The idea is, instead of printing out tickets when entering stores (for business useing this type of queing system) everything is online and on personal devices. This application is a sustainable way of thinking and can be used in any store that uses any sort of queuing system, using numbers.
